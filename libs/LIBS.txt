
These instructions are only expected to be required on Windows, though
I haven't tried compiling this wrapper on other platforms yet. 

Unpack your binary distribution of leptonica and tesseract
to the 'leptonica' and 'tesseract' directories. When finished, you 
should end up with a directory structure that looks like this. 

    leptonica\
        include\
            leptonica\
        libs\
        
    tesseract\
        include\
            tesseract\
        libs\
        
Tesseract
=========
        
The latest version of the tesseract files can be obtained from

    http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/downloads/list
    
And the file that you're looking for is:

    tesseract-3.02.02-win32-lib-include-dirs.zip
    
Leptonica
=========
    
The latest version of the leptonica files can be obtained from

    http://code.google.com/p/leptonica/downloads/list
    
And the file that you're looking for is:

    leptonica-1.68-win32-lib-include-dirs.zip
